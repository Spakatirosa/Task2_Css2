Sass: A CSS Preprocessor
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS by adding features like variables, nesting, mixins, and more. It allows you to write more organized, maintainable, and efficient stylesheets.

Key Differences Between Sass and Regular CSS
Variables: Sass allows you to define variables to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheet.
Nesting: You can nest CSS rules within each other for better organization and readability.
Mixins: Mixins are reusable blocks of code that can be included in other stylesheets.
Partials: Partials are Sass files that are not compiled directly but can be imported into other Sass files.
Functions: Sass provides built-in functions and allows you to define custom functions for complex calculations or operations.
Example Sass File
SCSS
// variables.scss
$primary-color: #007bff;
$secondary-color: #6c757d;

// mixins.scss
@mixin button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

// styles.scss
@import 'variables';
@import 'mixins';

.button {
  @include button;
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
}

.secondary-button {
  @include button;
  background-color: $secondary-color;
  color: black;
}
Use code with caution.

Resulting CSS After Compilation
CSS
.button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
}

.secondary-button {
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: #6c757d;
  color: black;
}
Use code with caution.

Notable Differences
Nesting: The Sass code is more organized due to the nested rules.
Variables: The $primary-color and $secondary-color variables are used to define the button colors.
Mixins: The @mixin button block is used to define a reusable button style.
Partials: The variables.scss and mixins.scss files are imported into the styles.scss file.
By using these features, Sass allows you to write more efficient, maintainable, and scalable stylesheets.
