Theming in CSS: A Guide to Dynamic Styling
Theming in CSS refers to the process of creating multiple stylesheets or using variables to control the overall appearance of a website. This allows users to switch between different themes, such as light and dark modes, to suit their preferences or improve accessibility.

Implementing Theming with Sass
Sass is a powerful CSS preprocessor that offers several features to simplify the theming process:

Variables: Define variables to store common style values like colors, fonts, and spacing. This makes it easy to change the theme by updating the variables.
Mixins: Create reusable blocks of code that can be included in other stylesheets. This helps organize and maintain your theme styles.
Nesting: Nest CSS rules within each other for better organization and readability.
Creating a Simple Theme Switcher
Here's a basic example of a theme switcher using Sass and variables:

SCSS
$primary-color: #007bff;
$secondary-color: #6c757d;
$background-color: #fff;
$text-color: #000;

// Light theme
.light-theme {
  --primary-color: $primary-color;
  --secondary-color: $secondary-color;
  --background-color: $background-color;
  --text-color: $text-color;
}

// Dark   
 theme
.dark-theme {
  --primary-color: #6c757d;
  --secondary-color: #007bff;
  --background-color: #121212;
  --text-color: #fff;
}

// Use variables in your styles
body {
  background-color: var(--background-color);
  color: var(--text-color);
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  color: var(--text-color);   

}
Use code with caution.

In the HTML:

HTML
<button id="theme-toggle">Toggle Theme</button>
Use code with caution.

JavaScript to toggle the theme:

JavaScript
const themeToggle = document.getElementById('theme-toggle');
const body = document.body;

themeToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
  body.classList.toggle('dark-theme');   

});
Use code with caution.

Explanation
Sass variables are defined for common styles.
Two themes (light-theme and dark-theme) are created using these variables.
The CSS rules use var() to reference the variables, making it easy to change the theme by applying the appropriate class.
The JavaScript toggles the dark-theme class on the body element to switch between themes.
By using Sass variables and themes, you can create dynamic and customizable stylesheets that adapt to different user preferences and improve the overall user experience.
