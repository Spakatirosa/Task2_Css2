CSS Compilation: From Preprocessor to Stylesheet
CSS compilation is the process of converting a preprocessed CSS file into a standard CSS file that can be understood by web browsers. CSS preprocessors, such as Sass or LESS, offer extended features like variables, nesting, and mixins that are not supported by regular CSS. These preprocessors compile the enhanced code into standard CSS that browsers can interpret.

How CSS Compilation Works
Parsing: The preprocessor parses the source code, analyzing its structure and identifying the specific features being used.
Evaluation: The preprocessor evaluates variables, functions, and other expressions within the code.
Nesting and Mixins: If present, the preprocessor handles nesting and mixins, expanding them into their corresponding CSS rules.
Output Generation: The preprocessor generates the compiled CSS code, replacing preprocessor-specific syntax with standard CSS.
Compiling Sass to CSS
Here's a simple example demonstrating the compilation process:

Sass Code:

SCSS
$primary-color: #007bff;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
Use code with caution.

Compiled CSS:

CSS
.button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
Use code with caution.

In this example, the Sass variable $primary-color is replaced with its actual value during compilation, resulting in the standard CSS output.

Note: To compile Sass code, you can use command-line tools like Sass or integrate it into your development workflow using tools like Webpack or Gulp. These tools automate the compilation process, ensuring that your stylesheets are always up-to-date.
